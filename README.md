##SaveToDocxFromPages

A simple applescript to save the document from the top windowe in pages to a docx file. I use it with Keyboard Maestro with the command CTRL-S to skip over the export to Microsoft Word process.

##NewDraftAlfred
script is called by an alfred 3 hotkey to open drafts5 and bring it into focuswith a new draft open waiting for text entry.
